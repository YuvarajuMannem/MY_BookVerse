ðŸ“š MY Book Verse
MY Book Verse is a simple, clean, and professional web application that allows users to create an account, add their favorite books, and read books shared by others. Books are described by title, cover image URL, and a "read" URL (such as a PDF or online document). The UI is inspired by Myntraâ€™s clean and vibrant style.

This projectâ€™s backend uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB Atlas, while the frontend is basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€“ ideal for beginners to learn web development, database integration, and user authentication.
